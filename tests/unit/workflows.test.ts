/**
 * WORKFLOW RAILS (#321, split out of `guardrails.test.ts`) — everything that reads `.github/workflows/**`
 * and `playwright.config.*`. Unchanged by the split.
 *
 * `workflow()` reads from disk rather than through Vite's glob, which does not reach `.github/`: an empty
 * read would make every rail here pass vacuously, which is the exact failure they exist to prevent. The
 * helper asserts its own length for that reason (`tests/unit/helpers/sources.ts`).
 *
 * A handful of workflow assertions still sit inside the `guard rails` describe in `guardrails.test.ts`,
 * interleaved with `src/` rails in the same `it`. Extracting those would mean rewriting them, and #321 is
 * explicitly a move and not a rewrite, so they stayed.

/**
 * #123: `playwright.config.ts` used to hard-code `localhost:4173` in both `use.baseURL` and `webServer`,
 * with `reuseExistingServer: true`. Two worktrees reviewing two pull requests then attach to whichever
 * server happened to start first — the served app comes from one checkout, the spec file from another, and
 * nothing anywhere says they disagree. It cost a routine run four fabricated test failures before it was
 * caught (see the issue). These two rails hold the fix in place: the port must be derived rather than a bare
 * literal shared with `reuseExistingServer`, and a real e2e test must fail loudly the moment the served build
 * and the local `dist/` disagree, so the failure mode becomes impossible to miss instead of merely rarer.

/**
 * #111 — the "Android APK" run carried two warning annotations on every run: six actions pinned at a major
 * that GitHub was forcing onto Node 24 despite targeting Node 20, plus `setup-java@v4` specifically flagged as
 * no longer receiving updates. Bumped every one of those six, in all three workflow files (`ci.yml` and
 * `review-gate.yml` share `actions/checkout` and pick up their own Node-20-only actions too), to the first
 * major release of each that ships `runs.using: node24` (confirmed against each action's own `action.yml` on
 * GitHub, not assumed from a changelog): `actions/checkout` v4→v5, `actions/setup-node` v4→v5,
 * `actions/setup-java` v4→v5, `actions/upload-artifact` v4→v6 (v5 still targets Node 20 — the jump is
 * deliberate, not a typo), `android-actions/setup-android` v3→v4, `gradle/actions/setup-gradle` v4→v5,
 * `softprops/action-gh-release` v2→v3, `actions/github-script` v7→v8. Checked each bump's `inputs:` against
 * what this repository actually passes (`distribution`/`java-version` for setup-java, `name`/`path`/
 * `retention-days` for upload-artifact) before landing it — none of the inputs this repo uses changed shape.
 *
 * This rail is deliberately a flat pinned-version list, not a "some Node-20-only major" pattern: the next
 * deprecation will name a *different* set of majors, and a rail that already knew today's list would need
 * editing to catch a new one anyway. What it prevents is today's list creeping back via a copy-paste from an
 * old workflow file or an example in an issue body.
 *
 * Prove it red: put any one of the OLD pins back into any workflow file.
