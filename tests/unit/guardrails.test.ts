/**
 * GUARD RAILS (#73) — checks that fail the build so a mistake we have already made cannot come back.
 * Every rail names the incident it prevents. Two rules for whoever edits this file:
 *   1. A *budget* rail (`toBeLessThanOrEqual(N)`) records existing debt. Lower N when you remove a case.
 *      NEVER raise one to make a build pass — that is the whole point of the rail.
 *   2. If a rail is wrong, fix it deliberately and say why in the commit; do not delete it quietly.
 *
 * Rails that need a browser live in `tests/e2e/game.spec.ts` under "guard rail:" — frame rate, and the
 * stylesheet ones. Vitest cannot read CSS text (Vite's css plugin returns an empty string for `?raw`
 * and `?inline` outside the browser), so a CSS rail written here would pass vacuously, which is worse
 * than no rail at all. Game wording is enforced separately in `british.test.ts` (#47).
